  The following additional hardening measures were implemented (please check: c3-app_solution.yml and c3-s3_solution.yml):

1.- The " RecipeWebServiceInstance" is deployed in a private subnet, and it does not use any KeyPair; access to the SSH port (TCP/22) in the SG was removed. 
2.- The EBS disks used in the instances are encrypted at rest.
3.- Public access to the S3 buckets was blocked. The original c3-s3.yml file does not have public access blocked on the S3 buckets, so an object can be made public and accessed through its public DNS name. Making the secret_recipe.txt public will bypass the policy "InstanceRolePolicy-C3" making the file accessible from everywhere
